# CSS-My_Site
# Introduction
This is a personal website project. This can be used to create simple person websites, it doesn't have any complex code. Easy to modify according to your own needs. Just a little bit of playaround, like deleting few lines of code and viewing it with google web developer tools will get you going with modifying this project.
# Instructions for using the project
I have separate folders for css and images, I have used links like that in index.html. So I recommend downloading the project as a zip file. So that you don't want to worry about changing the links in the index.html page.
